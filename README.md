# MahallahRegistrationSystem

In this project, we made a Mahallah Registration System that was inspired from our other software project. We are dedicated on fixing the Mahallah Management System 
in International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM) after going through the hassle of registering into a Mahallah ourselves. We sought a way to ease not only students but also the university managements using technologies that is easily acquired nowadays. From our observation, the current registration system is only picking the Mahallah. Even after picking, students still need to fill up a form during registration and rush to the Mahallah Office to re-register and pick their desired block and room. Our system combines all the needed procedure at one place.
