# MahallahRegistrationSystem

- In this project, we made a Mahallah Registration System that was inspired from our other software project. We are dedicated on fixing the Mahallah Management System 
in International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM) after going through the hassle of registering into a Mahallah ourselves. We sought a way to ease not only students but also the university managements using technologies that is easily acquired nowadays. From our observation, the current registration system is only picking the Mahallah. Even after picking, students still need to fill up a form during registration and rush to the Mahallah Office to re-register and pick their desired block and room. Our system combines all the needed procedure at one place.

- Our program consists of 5 classes in total. Starting of with the Main class, we build it as a place to load the login scene. Next, the Controller class is built for Validation for the login scene and a place to access multiple scenes: Dashboard, Register Mahallah, View Details, Login and Logout. Third, the controllerAM class that stands for AddMahallah will be having a form that consists of text fields and choice boxes. Weâ€™ll be taking all the user inputs as our object arguments in this class. Our Fourth class is controllerVD that stands for View Details. Its an implementation of TableView and ObservableList to display all the added values from controllerAM class. Lastly is the Person class, which is a class to construct all our objects. Below are the UML Diagram that will show each class with more details.
