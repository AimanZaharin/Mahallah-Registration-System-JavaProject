# 🕌 Mahallah Registration System

A Java-based desktop application built for my **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** coursework. This system was designed to modernize and improve the Mahallah (hostel) registration process at **International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM)**.

---

## 📌 Introduction

After personally experiencing the hassle of Mahallah registration at IIUM, I was inspired to build a solution that simplifies and streamlines the process. The current system only allows students to select a Mahallah, but further steps—such as filling out a form and rushing to the Mahallah office—are still done manually.

This project combines all necessary steps into one place, providing a smoother, more efficient registration experience for both students and university staff.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Apply principles of object-oriented programming (OOP).
- Implement a fully functional Java GUI application using JavaFX.
- Practice building UML diagrams and software documentation.
- Strengthen my understanding of Java, JavaFX, and desktop application architecture.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- **Java**
- **JavaFX**
- **Gluon Scene Builder** – used to design UI scenes.
- **Eclipse IDE** – used to write, run, and test the Java code.

---

## 🧱 Project Structure

The program consists of five main classes:

- **Main.java**  
  Loads the login scene and launches the application.

- **Controller.java**  
  Manages navigation, login validation, and controls access to scenes like Dashboard, Register Mahallah, View Details, Login, and Logout.

- **ControllerAM.java**  
  (Add Mahallah) Handles user input using text fields and choice boxes. This class collects and stores the inputs as objects.

- **ControllerVD.java**  
  (View Details) Displays added data using `TableView` and `ObservableList`.

- **Person.java**  
  A model class used to construct all the required objects for the system.
